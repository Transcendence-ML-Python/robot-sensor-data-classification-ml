# ML algorithms: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Single and Multi-layer Perceptron, SVM and XGBoost 
Using the signal information from 24 sensors to predict the movement of robot.
The 24 sensor data was processed and transformed to 4 input values. 
Applying Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Single and Multi-layer Perceptron, SVM and XGBoost algorithms
Used Streamlit to generate a web based interface to display the output.
This dataset is a perfectly balanced dataset so the Decision Tree and XGBosst provide 100% accuracy. Tested it with different split and the result was not changing

This was done as a part of group coursework (COMM055, University of Surrey). 
The members of group are Amit Bechelet, Hisham Parol, Namra Sultan and Donald James.
